All tree stories allow you to play around with styles! (Refresh to apply styles. Working on improving UX here. Here is a rabbit for inconvenience caused. üê∞)

Feel styling options are limited? You can always override them with CSS. All the tree components are given id `react-tree-vis`. Refer to [this CSS file](https://github.com/VandanRogheliya/react-tree-vis/blob/master/src/styles/BinarySearchTree.css) for selectors. Also check out [this codesandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/s/overriding-css-mwp9b?file=/src/styles.css).
